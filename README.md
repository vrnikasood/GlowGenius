## GlowGenius 🌟 
Your Personalized Guide to Skincare & Cosmetic Product Discovery

GlowGenius is a clean, intuitive web-based platform that helps users discover personalized cosmetic and skincare products without the overwhelm. Designed with simplicity and purpose, it offers concern-based solutions (like acne, dryness, or pigmentation) and category-based browsing (serums, moisturizers, lipsticks, etc.), allowing users to explore products that match their needs and preferences.

Unlike bloated e-commerce sites or one-size-fits-all beauty guides, GlowGenius focuses on curated, user-centric discovery — with smart filters, platform comparisons (Nykaa, Amazon, etc.), and trusted influencer picks on the roadmap.

## Inspiration 💡
Skincare and beauty discovery is often overwhelming due to the sheer number of products and scattered information. GlowGenius was born from the need for a clean, structured, and intuitive way to explore products based on real user needs rather than generic listings.
